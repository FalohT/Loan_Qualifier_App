<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Here are some screenshots and code snippets of the working app

#### Confirm Dialogue - Enter No and exit the program
![Confirm Dialogue Screen Shot][confirm-screenshot]

#### Qualified Loans - saves to the qualified_loans folder
![Qualified Loan Screen Shot][qualifiedloan-screenshot]


#### Unqualified Loans - saves to the unqualified_loans folder
![Unqualified Loan Screen Shot][unqualifiedloan-screenshot]


#### Enter Name - forces a retry. User can then enter y/n
![Enter Name Screen Shot][entername-screenshot]


#### Save Function
  ```sh
  def save_qualifying_loans(qualifying_loans):
    """Saves the qualifying loans to a CSV file.
        Requires confirmation before saving the file
        Provides instructions for the file naming convention
        Includes logic to avoid empty filenames
        
    Args:
        qualifying_loans (list of lists): The qualifying bank loans.
    """
    #Ask if the user wants to save the file
    question = questionary.confirm("Would you like to save the new file?").ask()

    if question == False:
        print("")
        print("Thank you for using the app. Goodbye!")
        quit()
    else:
        # Enter the new file name to be saved by the application
        name = questionary.text("""Enter the new file name by following these rules:
        1. Use lowercase letters
        2. Don't leave empty spaces between words.
        3. Use the underscore _ as a separator.
        4. Include .csv at the end of the name.
        5. For example: john_doe.csv"""
        ).ask()

        if name == "":
            print("")
            print("You must enter a file name")
            print("")
            save_qualifying_loans(qualifying_loans)
        
        if len(qualifying_loans) == 0:
            output_path = Path(f"results/unqualified_loans/{name.lower()}")
            save_csv(output_path, qualifying_loans)
        else:
            output_path = Path(f"results/qualified_loans/{name.lower()}")
            save_csv(output_path, qualifying_loans)
   ```

#### Save to CSV Function 
  ```sh
  def save_csv(output_path, qualifying_loans):
    """Saves the CSV file from path provided by user input.
        Checks to make sure the file was written and notifies the user

    Args:
        output_path (Path): The csv file output path from user input.
        qualifying_loans : List of qualifying loans from calculations.

    Saves:
        A list that contains the rows of qualifying loans for a customer.

    """
    header = ["Lender", "Max Loan Amount", "Max LTV", "Max DTI", "Min Credit Score", "Interest Rate"]
    with open(output_path, 'w', newline = '') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(header)

        for loans in qualifying_loans:
            csvwriter.writerow(loans)
        if os.path.isfile(output_path):
            print(f'The file {csvfile.name} was successfully written')
        else:
            print(f'The file {output_path} was not written')
